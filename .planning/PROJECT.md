# OpenFacilitator

## What This Is

A multi-tenant crypto payment facilitator with a rewards program that pays users $OPEN tokens for volume processed. Users can create facilitators, manage products, and earn rewards. The platform supports both Solana and Base chains for payments and subscriptions.

## Core Value

Users who process volume through OpenFacilitator get rewarded with $OPEN tokens. Facilitator owners get seamless subscription management with multi-chain support.

## Current State

**Shipped:**
- v1.0 Rewards Program (2026-01-20)
- v1.1 SDK & Docs (2026-01-21)
- v1.2 Subscription Wallet Overhaul (2026-01-23)

## Current Milestone: v1.3 Trim & Audit

**Goal:** Remove unused features ($OPEN rewards program + storefronts) and run a full security audit on the slimmed surface area.

**Target work:**
- Remove storefronts (admin/facilitator route surface, db/storefronts, dashboard section)
- Remove $OPEN rewards program (DB tables, /rewards/* routes, dashboard rewards UI, 2x multiplier, claims engine, SPL transfer code, signature verification flows, rewards env vars)
- Security audit of the remaining surface area (auth, payments, signing, multi-tenant isolation)

**Why these removals:** Neither feature found product-market fit. Removing them shrinks the attack surface before the security audit and lets the project refocus on what's working (multi-tenant facilitator + subscriptions).

**Constraints:**
- Keep multi-chain wallet infra (v1.2 subscriptions depend on it)
- `## Core Value` will be rewritten as part of this milestone — facilitator + subscriptions is the new pitch
- Audit runs LAST so it isn't wasted on dead code

**Codebase:**
- Dashboard: ~18,000 LOC TypeScript/React
- Server: SQLite + Better Auth + Hono
- SDK: x402 v1 and v2 type support with TypeScript narrowing
- 3 milestones shipped, 21 phases, 37 plans executed

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 15.5 + React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- @solana/wallet-adapter-react for Solana wallets
- wagmi + viem for EVM wallets
- @solana/web3.js + @solana/spl-token for token transfers
- node-cron for billing automation

### Future

- Dashboard features spotlight for discoverability
- Email notifications when threshold reached or claim available
- Sybil cluster detection dashboard for admins
- Prorated refunds for mid-cycle cancellation
- Fund button with checkout flow (alternative to direct addresses)

### Out of Scope

- Leaderboards — deferred to post-launch based on demand
- Gamification (badges, streaks) — distraction from core value
- KYC verification — adds friction, not needed for loyalty program
- Complex tier systems — simplicity is a feature
- Mobile app — web dashboard sufficient
- OAuth login — email/password + wallet sufficient

## Context

**Production readiness:**
- Rewards wallet needs funding (REWARDS_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY env var)
- OPEN_TOKEN_MINT address needs configuration
- CRON_SECRET for volume snapshot AND subscription billing cron
- First campaign needs creation via /rewards/admin

**Known limitations:**
- Single active campaign at a time (by design)
- 5 address limit per user (anti-gaming)
- 30-day claim window after campaign ends

## Constraints

- **Database**: SQLite (existing) — all tables in same DB
- **Auth**: Better Auth (existing) — extends auth context
- **UI**: Integrated into existing dashboard
- **Token**: $OPEN on Solana — SPL token transfers via @solana/spl-token
- **Timeline**: v1.0-v1.2 shipped, claims available March 2026

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Integrate into existing dashboard | Reduces complexity, leverages existing auth | ✓ Good |
| SQLite for all tables | Consistent with existing infra | ✓ Good |
| Solana signature verification (Ed25519) | Industry standard, users already have wallets | ✓ Good |
| EVM signature verification (EIP-191) | Industry standard for Ethereum | ✓ Good |
| Proportional distribution | Fair allocation based on contribution | ✓ Good |
| Soft anti-gaming (track, don't block) | Gaming is acceptable CAC for v1 | — Pending |
| Snapshot + live delta for volume | Efficient aggregation at scale | ✓ Good |
| Ephemeral wallet connection for claims | Security - don't store wallet keys | ✓ Good |
| Combined initiate + execute claim | Atomic operation, simpler UX | ✓ Good |
| 5 address limit per user | Balance flexibility vs abuse prevention | ✓ Good |
| Single active campaign | Simplicity, clear rules for users | ✓ Good |
| Literal x402Version types (1, 2) | Enables TypeScript narrowing | ✓ Good |
| PaymentRequirements field presence discrimination | No version field needed, use maxAmountRequired | ✓ Good |
| getVersionSafe defaults to v1 | Backward compatibility with pre-versioning payloads | ✓ Good |
| Middleware-first refund docs | Simpler DX for most merchants | ✓ Good |
| Facilitator markers in reward_addresses | Reuses existing volume aggregation queries | ✓ Good |
| Show wallet addresses directly | Power user friendly, direct deposits | ✓ Good |
| 7-day grace period | Standard industry practice | ✓ Good |
| Pre-fund any amount | Flexibility for users | ✓ Good |
| No mid-cycle refunds | Simpler, subscription runs until end | ✓ Good |

| node-cron for billing | Built-in, no external scheduler needed | ✓ Good |
| Notification duplicate prevention | 24h/72h windows prevent spam | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
